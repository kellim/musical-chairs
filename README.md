# Musical Chairs: Automated

This app lets you automate starting and stopping music in a Musical Chairs game. Music in each round is played for a random amount of seconds between a minimum and maximum amount chosen. You can also choose how long to wait between each
round in order to give the players time to remove a player and a chair before the next round starts.
